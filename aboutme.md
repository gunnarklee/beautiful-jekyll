<p>Python for makers is a joint venture between two Data Science Companies. Bereley Data Science Group and Austin Capitall Data. Durning the day we do consulting and education work through our companies and by night we transmit data science tools to the broader community. It  is our core belief that by engaging on corportate contracts, then taking engaging in an open dialogue exhange of data science tools and techniques with the community we can broaden and strengthen data scinece and the maker community. </p>
  
<p> This class is a series intended to teach you the essential basics of programming using Python and how to apply these basics to make things. The course can be taken a-la-carte based on the topic or can be attended regularly to become a well rounded python coder. I will cover all aspects of python language over the series. </p>
